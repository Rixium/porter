### Porter

Porter is an open-source documentation repository app made in **Rust**!  
A CLI-based application that will work with any text editor.

Ever been frustrated with internal knowledge being spread out and lost in threads on Slack, Teams, and all over Confluence?  
Porter is intended to store a repository of developer knowledge often hidden away in the depths of engineers' brains.

## Why Porter?

Originally it was intended to be called **Dock** because the aim was to store large numbers of easy-to-search and easy-to-edit documentation (think cargo containers).  
But that was a bit too much like Docker, so now it's called **Porter**, which is like “port,” which is kind of the same idea.. but feel free to interpret it however you like.

## What's it solving?

Working at companies where ancient knowledge is passed between team members can be frustrating.  
There's often no agreement among teams about how information should be stored.  

Devs can be super lazy, but also love hacky CLI applications (am I right?).  
Porter bridges that gap: it acts as a developer tool for developers to store their knowledge that can then be easily searched and accessed, all at the repository level.
