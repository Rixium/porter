### Porter

Porter is an open-source documentation repository app made in RUST!
A CLI based application that will work with any text-editor.

Ever been frustrated with internal knowledge being spread out and lost in threads on Slack, Teams, and all over Confluence?
Porter is intended to be used to store a repository of developer knowledge often hidden away in the depths of engineers brains.

## Why Porter?

Originally it was intended to be called dock because the aim was to store large numbers of easy to search and edit documentation (think cargo containers).. but that was a bit too much like docker, so now it's called porter, which is like port, which is kind of the same thing, but feel free to interpret it however you like.

## What's it solving?

With constant frustration about working at companies where ancient knowledge is passed between team members, there's no agreement amongst different teams about how all this information is stored.
Devs can be super lazy, but also, devs loves hacky CLI applications (am i right?). So this is going to bridge that gap, act as a developer tool for developers to store their ancient knowledge that can then be easily grepped. No more of these obsidians. Us devs love our vims and emacs, so lets keep the information on a repository level.
